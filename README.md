## Introduction

AUREUM leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure that charitable funds are collected, managed, and distributed in a transparent and trustless manner. By using a DAO, we eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing overhead costs and ensuring that donations reach those in need more efficiently.

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge-Based ID System**: Ensures user privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance, allowing users to prove their identity without revealing personal information.
- **Transparent Donations**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Donors can vote on proposals for fund distribution. Renounce votes if deemed necessary.
- **Secure**: Built on the Concordium blockchain, which provides strong privacy features and regulatory compliance.
- **Automated Processes**: Smart contract automate the collection and distribution of funds.
