# AUREUM - Concordium Charity DAO

Welcome to the **AUREUM**, a Charity DAO DApp, built on the **Concordium** blockchain (currently exclusive to residents of India). This project aims to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to manage and distribute charitable donations transparently and efficiently.

## Introduction

AUREUM leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure that charitable funds are collected, managed, and distributed in a transparent and trustless manner. By using a DAO, we eliminate the need for intermediaries, reduce overhead costs, and ensure that donations reach those in need more efficiently.

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge-Based ID System**: Ensures user privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance, allowing users to prove their identity without revealing personal information.
- **Transparent Donations**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Donors can vote on proposals for fund distribution. Renounce votes if deemed necessary.
- **Secure**: Built on the Concordium blockchain, which provides strong privacy features and regulatory compliance.
- **Automated Processes**: Smart contract automate the collection and distribution of funds.

> **Note:** Anyone can propose a charity in the application, but voting power is granted to those who deposit amount into the smart contract.

## Getting Started

### Docker Setup

The easiest way to run the AUREUM application is by using **Docker**.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr1sm0s1n/aureum-dao.git
cd aureum-dao
```

2. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
make up
```

This will build the client and server in a Docker container and start the application.

3. Access the application:

Once the container is running, you can access the AUREUM DAO app by navigating to http://localhost:4800 in your browser.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the application without Docker, you'll need to install the prerequisites.

#### Prerequisites

- **Rust** for compiling and running the backend.
- **Node.js** for building the frontend.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr1sm0s1n/aureum-dao.git
cd aureum-dao
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

4. Build the frontend:

```bash
make client
```

5. Build and start the backend:

```bash
make run
```

This will launch the application on http://localhost:4800.

> **Note:** Country of residence can be updated based on the need. Simply edit [`statement.json`](./server/config/statement.json).

## Usage

### Testing the Smart Contract

**Rust** is required for the following steps.

1. Install `cargo-concordium`:

```bash
make concordium
```

2. Build the smart contract:

```bash
make contract
```

3. Test the smart contract:

```bash
make test
```

### Deploying the Smart Contract

Check out the [Developer Docs](https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/smart-contracts/guides/quick-start.html) for instructions.

Update the [`config.ts`](./client/src/config/config.ts) file with the latest `CONTRACT_INDEX`, `MODULE_REF` and `RAW_SCHEMA_BASE64` if necessary.
